# LandArchTools
Custom Tools for landscape Architects

A set of python scripts integral to the Landscape Architectural proffesion that are lacking in the Rhinocerous 3D Modelling Software.
These tools will only work for metric users. 
DDA ramp tool is meant only as a reference and should not be assumed accurate to Australian DDA guidelines.
