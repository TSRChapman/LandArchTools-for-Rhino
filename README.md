# LandArchTools for Rhino
Custom Tools for landscape Architects

A set of python scripts integral to the Landscape Architectural proffesion that are lacking in the Rhinocerous 3D Modelling Software.
These tools will only work for metric users. 
DDA ramp tool is meant only as a reference and should not be assumed accurate to Australian DDA guidelines.

Toolbar can be loaded by dragging and dropping the "LandArch Tools.rui" file into Rhino.
If the toolbar does not pop up, open your toolbar settings and select LandArch Tools from the options.
